# Miscellaneous Batch Files
Just some sample batch files I use on a regular basis.  There are better tools out there for this, but for a quick and dirty, these work great for me.

# LogParser
I only need certain information from the IIS logs:  The c-ip, a certain page that was visited, date/time.  The Log Parser program does a really good interactive job of pulling this data, but this batch file is so much easier.
