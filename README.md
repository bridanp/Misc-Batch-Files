# Miscellaneous Batch Files
Just some sample batch files I use on a regular basis.  There are better tools out there for this, but for a quick and dirty, these work great for me.

# CompanySite
There's this ungodly spreadsheet that I have to pull company and site information from.  Ungodly because of the merged cells and just flat out garbage arrangement of the thing.  To get around this, I download it as a csv, then use this batch file to just pull what is necessary.  Turns an hour long ordeal into a 2-minute non-event.

# LogParser
I only need certain information from the IIS logs:  The c-ip, a certain page that was visited, date/time.  The Log Parser program does a really good interactive job of pulling this data, but this batch file is so much easier.
